    I wrote and developed hiring criteria which ultimately and significantly

**Communications:** Customer Service, Customized Conversations, Creativity

-   **_Full-bodied Communications Plan:_** Through various one-on-one, written and
    strategic communications, in just 2 years, as reported by an outside
    industry expert agency, improved 140+ field employee satisfaction scores
    from a 3-5 to solid nine's in eleven categories. Part of this activity
    involved an internal “culture” change. It required assisting in-house team
    to learn about diversity and cultural nuances and improved listening and
    communicating skills.

-   **_Listening Skills:_** With highly conscientious, observational and careful
    listening skills, followed by thoughtful and clarifying questions, work is
    completed right the first time. In addition, high EQ skills allows the
    customer to feel heard and supported, thus providing a positive working
    experience.

-   In order to serve and educate my customers, I developed a catalog of health
    articles, resources, and referral partners for their use.

    documentation that reflect various learning styles in order to assist
    clients/customers with software installations or usage.

    protocols to find workable solutions for clients by implementing thoughtful
    client/customer feedback.

    evacuation team that performed its duties without casualty or injury in
    multiple emergency scenarios.

-   For a multi-million dollar international shipping company, I performed an
    audit of invoices and corresponding bills of lading and discovered \$1.8mm
    in uncollected receivables.

-   As a Massage Therapist, because sometimes client issues go beyond my scope
    of practice, I spent years networking with health professionals. I now
    frequently refer patients to other healthcare providers for curative care as
    an alternative to continued massage therapy for pain management or advanced
    mobility issues.
